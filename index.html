                <h3>Art Gallery</h3>
                <p>
                  A remarkable 90,000 works of art live inside the walls of the
                  Art Gallery of Ontario, one of the biggest and best art
                  museums in North America. Observe the lauded work of Canada's
                  'Group of Seven' art collective, part of the largest
                  collection of Canadian art in the world. Then travel the
                  globe, from the African Art Gallery to the extensive European
                  collection, and travel back in time, from the Renaissance and
                  Baroque eras to the present day. Photography, sculpture,
                  graphic art, installations; Rubens, Goya, Picasso and
                  Rembrandt; the AGO covers it all. Even the building is a work
                  of art. World-renowned architect and Toronto-born Frank Gehry,
                  the man behind the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed an
                  expansion to the AGO in 2008 that has earned critical acclaim.
                  If you love art, there's no better place in the city to be.

                <h3>Toronto Islands</h3>
                <p>
                  You only need to travel 10 minutes from the city of Toronto to
                  enter a completely different world. Hop on a ferry and embark
                  on a journey to the Toronto Islands, an attraction-filled
                  destination where relaxation is the name of the game. There
                  are no cars, so you're going to want to rent a bike or
                  rollerblades to explore the chain of islands -- the three big
                  ones being Centre, Ward's and Algonquin -- which are connected
                  by a series of pathways and bridges. Along the water you'll
                  find four beautiful beaches, while summer cottages from the
                  1920s and impressive English gardens are one of the main draws
                  on land. A maze on the islands serves to test your wits, while
                  the haunted lighthouse tests your courage. From picnics, to
                  paddleboats, to ponies, the Toronto Islands offer a great
                  contrast to the busy city while still enjoying the view of the
                  skyline! Ut, doloribus!

                <h3>Ontario Musuem</h3>
                <p>
                  The Royal Ontario Museum is the biggest museum of world
                  cultures and natural history in Canada. Located right in
                  downtown Toronto, the striking main entrance to the museum,
                  known as The Crystal and designed by Michael Lee Chin, will
                  draw you in right away. Inside, the museum houses exhibits
                  that run the gamut from dinosaurs to ancient Egypt to Canada's
                  First Nations. It's hard to categorize the, oh, six
                  million-or-so objects the museum has in its collections, but
                  trust us, you'll be able to find something you really enjoy.
                  As you walk from floor to floor, past the 25-metre totem pole,
                  you'll encounter art, history, archeology, mineralogy,
                  geology, paleontology, zoology, and elements of any other
                  -ology you could probably imagine! With something new to
                  discover every time you visit, the 100-year-old museum is a
                  favorite of locals and tourists alike.

                <h3>Ripley's Aquarium</h3>
                <p>
                  Do you like the idea of coming face to face with a shark,
                  separated only by a pane of glass? The Ripley's Aquarium of
                  Canada allows you to live that experience, while exposing you
                  to another 16,000 marine animals hosted on site. It takes 5.7
                  million litres of water to host all of those animals, from
                  southern stingrays, to 65-year-old giant lobsters, to giant
                  pacific octopus, to nettle jellyfish. Explore life on the
                  reef, walk in safety under a dangerous lagoon, stick your head
                  in an underwater viewing bubble, or take in a stingray dive
                  show. Open 365 days a year, you can always turn to the
                  Ripley's Aquarium of Canada for an exciting day--whether it's
                  an angelfish on Christmas Day, or a stingray on your birthday.

                <h3>CN Tower</h3>
                <p>
                  One of Canada's greatest landmarks and one of the seven
                  wonders of the modern world, the CN Tower has come to define
                  the Toronto skyline. At 553 metres in height, this engineering
                  wonder is hard to miss during any trip through the city and
                  you don't want to miss it. Beyond being a very cool building
                  you can take an elevator up to the revolving 360 Restaurant
                  for world-class dining. Feeling a bit bold? Walk across the
                  glass floor, only 2.5 inches thick, 113 storeys above the
                  ground. Want an even bigger thrill? Travel up another 33
                  storeys to the Skypod lookout. Still not daring enough? Strap
                  on a harness, head outside, and take a thrilling walk along
                  the building's edge with nothing but air between you and the
                  ground, in the not-for-the-faint-of-heart EdgeWalk experience.
                  This adrenaline-inducing activity is actually the world's
                  highest 'hands-free walk,' so you can brag about that one to
                  your friends.

                <p>
                  Believe it or not, the only full-sized castle in North America
                  is actually located in Toronto. Casa Loma literally has
                  everything you could want from a castle. There are turrets
                  offering beautiful views of the city. There's a large library
                  and nearly 100 rooms to explore. There are secret passageways
                  to discover, including a 245-metre tunnel to the stables and
                  carriage house, the latter of which features an exhibit of
                  vintage cars from the early 1900's. Plus it has five acres of
                  gardens full of beautiful flowers, sculptures and fountains.
                  Plug in your headphones, listen to the digital audio guide,
                  and roam around a castle in the city.

              I am delighted to share a glimpse of my professional journey and
              aspirations in the world of travel. With certifications from
              esteemed organizations like TICO, Manulife, and as a Destination
              Specialist, I've cultivated a robust foundation of knowledge and
              expertise in the travel industry. These certifications serve as
              badges of dedication to delivering exceptional service and
              enriching experiences to travelers worldwide. Looking ahead, my
              aspirations are deeply rooted in continuous growth and evolution
              within this dynamic field. Over the next five years, I am
              committed to expanding my skill set, fostering meaningful
              connections, and embracing new opportunities for learning and
              development. Whether it's through further certifications, advanced
              training programs, or immersive experiences in diverse
              destinations, my goal is to elevate my expertise and enhance my
              contributions to the travel community. In this ever-evolving
              landscape, I am eager to explore emerging trends, technologies,
              and sustainability practices that shape the future of travel. By
              staying agile, adaptive, and forward-thinking, I aim to not only
              meet but exceed the evolving needs and expectations of travelers.
              Through collaboration, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of
              excellence, I am dedicated to carving a fulfilling and impactful
              path in the travel industry. Thank you for considering my journey
              and aspirations. I look forward to the adventures that lie ahead
              and the opportunity to contribute positively to the world of
              travel.
